# FlutterBudgetingApp
A budgeting app in Flutter. 

As you can see there are 3 items in the bottom navigation bar:
  1. The first is the budgeting page <img src="[https://github.com/favicon.ico](https://github.com/hessio/FlutterBudgetingApp/assets/23244853/c814b514-01b1-43dc-ae98-ba4c2302bf9b)" width="48">
  2. The second page is using the chatGPT api to ask questions. The idea was to make add the ability to ask questions that would be a starting point for imoroving the user's financial situation. [Needs to be implemented]
  3. App settings. [Needs to be implemented]
